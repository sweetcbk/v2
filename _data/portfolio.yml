  description: Crowd DJ is a web app that allows people who are at a party or social gathering with a DJ (who uses Spotify) to request songs via their smartphones. The web app allows people to see the currently playing song, request songs, upvote songs, and rate songs so the DJ can see how the crowd is feeling and act accordingly. In other words, Crowd DJ is essentially a crowdsourced music queue.

- title: Screentime 2.0
  demo: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.starry.management
  description: ScreenTime 2.0 was one of <a href="https://starry.com/" target="_blank">Starry</a>'s most important consumer-facing software updates on <a href="https://starry.com/station" target="_blank">Starry Station</a>, providing new functionality for users to easily filter content, pause the internet, and even create custom rules for blocking apps like Facebook and Twitter right from their mobile phones. As a co-op, I played a large role in the implementation of this feature on Starry's cordova android app, and was responsible for building out front-end designs, linking up back-end data, as well as communicating with designers and other engineers throughout the process. <br><br> Check out the Starry App on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.starry.management" target="_blank">Google Play</a>, and learn more about ScreenTime 2.0 on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/tech/screentime-for-starry-station" target="_blank">Product Hunt</a> and the <a href="https://blog.starry.com/whats-new-screentime-just-got-better-for-parents/" target="_blank">Starry Blog</a>.

  description: This is just an online version of my resume I made for fun. I was interested in learning React.js, so I found this <a href="https://medium.com/learning-new-stuff/building-your-first-react-js-app-d53b0c98dc#.1439cdewq">simple tutorial</a> and it kind of spun into this weekend project. I probably didn't need to use React at all, but hey, at least I learned a few things!

  description: This was my first portfolio website I built in 2014. It's a simple one-pager like this one, but relied heavily on Bootstrap. Since then, I think my web development and design skills have expanded immensely.

  description: CourseSource is a web application built on the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node) stack for my web development class in 2015. I created this web app with the intention of providing Northeastern Students a better experience browsing the courses offered at Northeastern (which is currently a painstakingly tedious task on our current student portal).
